        <p class="about-text">
          Mexican food is a vibrant and flavorful cuisine with a rich history
          that reflects the diverse culture of Mexico. It is renowned for its
          bold flavors, colorful presentations, and a harmonious blend of
          indigenous and European influences. The cuisine varies greatly by
          region, showcasing the unique traditions and ingredients of each area,
          from the spicy and hearty dishes of the north to the tropical flavors
          of the south. In the north, dishes often feature beef, goat, and flour
          tortillas, a nod to the region’s ranching heritage. Meanwhile, central
          Mexico highlights a rich mix of ingredients and iconic dishes like
          mole poblano, tamales, and barbacoa, reflecting its historical
          significance as the heart of Mexican culinary tradition. In contrast,
          southern Mexico embraces tropical ingredients such as plantains,
          cacao, and seafood, creating dishes like cochinita pibil and tlayudas
          that burst with unique flavors. Staples such as corn, beans, and
          chilies form the backbone of the cuisine, complemented by a variety of
          herbs and spices like cilantro, epazote, and cinnamon. Sauces,
          especially salsas, are essential, ranging from fiery and tangy to
          creamy and rich, adding depth and complexity to every meal. Beyond its
          flavors, Mexican cuisine is deeply tied to its cultural and spiritual
          roots. Food is central to celebrations, from the tamales and atole of
          Día de los Muertos to the fresh ceviche enjoyed during coastal
          festivals. It is a cuisine that tells a story—one of resilience,
          creativity, and the blending of old and new worlds.

            Food plays a vital role in Mexican traditions. During celebrations
            like Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), families prepare symbolic
            dishes such as pan de muerto, a sweet bread adorned with sugar.
            Festivals often feature elaborate meals, where recipes are shared,
            preserved, and cherished as a family legacy.
